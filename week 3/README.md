# WEEK 3
In this week, we will make the mode to convert real environment images to sketch images. I will make all of you contributors in this repo and you all will have to make folders with name <yourname> and push your work in that folder. Moreover, do the same thing in `week 2` folder and add the model you developed from scratch and also the one using python modules. 
Note that both these tasks are necessary for you to get certified.
