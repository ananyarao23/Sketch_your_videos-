# Week 2
## NN model from scratch
The task is to develop an NN model for classification from scratch using the base code provided and with the help of the nn_desc.pdf description. Untar the compressed data file using the following command and follow the commands in the pdf to run the base.py file.
```
tar -xvf data.tar.xz
```
You are free to modify the code file as you like, but use of any python library is **prohibited**. No extra modules should be imported. Ideally only the `TODO` blocks should be filled.
